<h3>Scope of Interactive Data Description</h3>
<div class="line-block">          For the interactive, we are looking to build 3-4 graphs that can provide further information about our data. Each of the graphs can be “customized” to look at specific countries and commodities. A user would be able to select countries to potentially further investigate the relationships between pricing, production, GDP, and their respective food waste. The main focus of these interactives is to be able to look more closely at food waste/loss on a country by country basis, but also be able to analyze the data from a macro perspective through regions/continents and consideration of other factors.</div>
<div class="line-block">          The data collected by FAO, as previously discussed in our posts, is sufficiently large and provides extensive historical data. It includes data based on country or region, so we thought that we should let the user filter in whichever way he(the user) desires. Maybe someone wants to look at the United States, or maybe they want to look at Oceania for food production.</div>
<div class="line-block">          It should be available now that we are increasing the scope of our graphs! This led to some more cleanup needing to be done on the backend, however, to make sure that there are no duplicates of sorts within the original dataset. The historical data is so users can examine loss trends based on years. Additionally, after the expansion of our data set to include more countries, we aim to create a heatmap to help visualize the food waste by areas around the world.</div>
<div class="line-block">          One of the ideas that our team came up with to make this interactive more personal for the individual was to add a “shopping list” function to our graphs. This would work by inputting a user’s grocery list of items, then outputting information in the form of graphs showing how the items they plan on buying have fluctuated in price and food waste over the years. One example of this is that a user would be able to see how much their shopping list would cost during the Great Recession. This is a fun way for the viewer to interact with our website on their own while also retaining valuable information. Hopefully, this could even work to make users more conscious of which foods that they buy are commonly wasted and to hopefully begin to tackle this problem. If this idea does not work out, we can just go with the idea to see trends over the years by the region as stated above.</div>
