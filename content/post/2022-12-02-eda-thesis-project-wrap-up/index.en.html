<h2>Project’s wrap-up overview:</h2>
<div class="line-block">      As for our core EDA, we are investigating the correlation between food waste and food production worldwide and finding causation in correlation to each country’s GDP.</div>
<div class="line-block">      We are continuing our exploratory data analysis by making graphs that may or may not make the final cut. For example, we have recently completed four graphs that explore which country lost over 40% in a specific year and which commodities were lost the most throughout history. Surprisingly, we found out that fruit juice – such as pineapple juice and orange juice lost the most production throughout the production &amp; retail process. However, our current data sets cannot explain the reason behind these findings.</div>
<div class="line-block">      After we found out US wastes the most amount of food, we created a graph exploring US’s food waste throughout history. We found out that the US’s food waste peaked in 2008, double the average across history. We suspect that there is a correlation between a country’s financial performance and its ability to control food waste. Thus, we will dig deeper into how GDP is connected with food waste. Does a country with higher GDP tend to waste more food (as % of total production)?</div>
<div class="line-block">      Our food waste &amp; loss data set includes detailed data for each country and each commodity across fifty years. We need help finding trends and tendencies across a dataset since there are too many dimensions. Therefore, we are exploring different options, such as using the country code to group countries by regions (Such as North America and Asia) or grouping commodities by the CDC code.</div>
