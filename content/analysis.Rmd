The world population recently surpass the 8 billion mark. According to World Food Program, around 828 million of people go to bed hungry every night all around the world and more than 49 million people in 49 countries are facing famine crisis. Our team is interested in exploring the relationships between food supply, food waste, GDP, population density and available land for agriculture among different countries. Furthermore, we are looking forward to exploring potential opportunities to mitigate food-waste and calculate world food availability for our current population density.  
  
As such, we aim to examine the relationship of food security on a worldwide scale using several macro indicators to better understand factors that contribute to food waste. The main variables that we have built our model on are Food Production, GDP, Agriculture as Percentage of GDP, Land Used for Agriculture, Population, and Regions/Continents. The goal is to examine how each of these factors relate to Food Loss via regression models. We will be testing the variables and their significance, and using those variables build a statistically appropriate model. 

Based on some of our exploratory data analysis, we have established a couple hypothesis that will expand upon the regression models. The following are hypotheses that we have proposed to guide the analysis:

 * Given GDP is a relatively effective signal of a countryâ€™s development, we hypothesize that higher GDP nations ("Developed Countries") will waste a greater percentage of food.
 * We hypothesize that there exists a significant correlation between food production and food waste
 * We hypothesize that if agriculture as a percentage of GDP is greater, the greater amount of food will be wasted 

```{r int, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
print(getwd())
FoodLossandWasteAllClean <- read_csv(here::here("dataset/FoodLossandWasteAllClean.csv"))
load(here::here("dataset/FoodLossandWasteAllClean.RData"))
print(ls())
```

Here, we started our analysis by checking out all the countries in an easy to see heatmap. Right off the bat, one can notice that the United States
is a main contributor to worldwide Food Waste. As the leading country in food waste, much of the following preliminary analysis will be focused on the US. This finding was important as it helped us developed our first hypothesis that there may exists some correlation with GDP and food waste.

The overall map is quite effective at providing a quick overview of what food waste is like worldwide by country. However, we did encounter some complications when making it. As outlined in our data page, because of the different naming methods between the dataset and package, we had to first change the dataset's country names to match the naming method of the package in order to generate the map using the "maps" package. For example, we had to change United States of America to USA.

```{r heatmapfoodwastebycountry, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(maps))
worlddata <- select(FoodLossandWasteAllClean, c('year','country','mean_loss_percentage'))
worlddata <- worlddata %>% filter(year > 2009 )

worlddata <- worlddata %>% group_by(year,country) %>% summarise_each(funs(sum))

worlddata <- worlddata %>% group_by(country) %>% summarise_each(funs(mean))

world_map <- map_data("world")
mydata<-worlddata
mydata$country[mydata$country == "United States of America"] <- "USA"
mydata$country[mydata$country == "Russian Federation"] <- "Russia"
world_map <- map_data("world")
world_map <- subset(world_map, region != "Antarctica")

#mapplot <- 
ggplot(mydata) + geom_map(dat = world_map, map = world_map, aes(map_id = region),fill = "white", color = "#7f7f7f", size = 0.25) +
geom_map(map = world_map, aes(map_id = country, fill = mean_loss_percentage), size = 0.25) +
scale_fill_gradient(low = "#fff7bc", high = "#cc4c02", name = "Mean Loss of Food Waste since 2010") +
expand_limits(x = world_map$long, y = world_map$lat)

#plotly::ggplotly(mapplot)

#world_map, fig.align='center'
```

```{r plot1_worldfoodloss, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
library(plotly)
# plotting food_waste before cleaning up the data
plot1 <-
  ggplot(FoodLossandWasteAllClean, aes(x = year, y = mean_loss_percentage, color = country)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3)+ geom_smooth(size=0.5, se = FALSE) + #se = false, is to remove the confidence bands
    ggtitle("Proportion of food waste since 1970") +

p1 <- plot1 + guides(color = FALSE)#+ scale_x_continuous(, 10)
#plot_ly(Food_waste,  x = ~year, y = ~mean_loss_percentage, color = ~country ) %>% add_markers()

US have the most "over 40% food loss per commodity per year" up to today, which is around two times the amount Mexico have. It is unimaginable how some commodity lose almost half of its amount during production & retail process. We want to look deeper into which commodity are incurring the most loss in US and if there is any reason behind it.

```{r 1, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
FoodLossandWasteAllClean %>%
  select(country,commodity, mean_loss_percentage)%>%
  filter(mean_loss_percentage >= 40)%>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise(count=n()) %>%
  filter(count > 5)%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = country, y = count)) +
  geom_col() + 
  labs(x= "Country", y = "number of commodities with over 40% loss")
```

The following graph indicates that in the US, Pineapple juice, Orange juice and grapefruit juice have been wasted the most over the past decades. One commonality between the most-wasted-commodity is that they are all juice. To extend outside our research, it could be interesting to examine some of the qualitative factors that is causing such a significant loss in this specific food type.

```{r 2, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
FoodLossandWasteAllClean %>%
  select(country,commodity, mean_loss_percentage)%>%
  filter(country == 'United States of America', mean_loss_percentage >= 40) %>%
  group_by(commodity) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  filter(count >=3)%>%
  arrange(count)%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = commodity, y = count))+
  geom_col()
```
The following graph explores the total summed food waste per year in the United States. In 2008, US incurred the most amount of food waste in the past five decades. A possible explanation for the severity of food wasted that year could be due to the impacts of the Financial Crisis. During this period, a lot of retailers and food processors went out of business. In addition, with significant unemployment, less food may have been consumed hence having gone bad before being sold. However, further data and research is need to support our theory. 

This specific analysis, though, motivated us to test the correlation of year, as a variable, with food loss. If there exists a correlation, we could use it to research qualitative factors of the corresponding year and why food loss was lower or higher. 

```{r 3, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
FoodLossandWasteAllClean %>%
  select(year,country,commodity, mean_loss_percentage)%>%
  filter(country == 'United States of America') %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(sum_loss_per_year = sum(mean_loss_percentage))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = sum_loss_per_year))+
  geom_line()+
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Sum of Loss Per Year")
```
The following data further explore the most wasted food in US. Besides juice, we observe that canned mushrooms, tomatoes, and spinach are also among the highest wasted food in the US.  

```{r 4, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=TRUE, fig.align='center'}
FoodLossandWasteAllClean %>%
  select(year,country,commodity, mean_loss_percentage)%>%
  filter(country == 'United States of America') %>%
  group_by(commodity) %>%
  summarise(sum_loss_per_year = sum(mean_loss_percentage))%>%
  arrange(desc(sum_loss_per_year))
```
  
This next section of our analysis will be more holistic and thus focusing more on the world as a whole. While we wanted to be able to examine food waste on a more detailed scale, by country, this would a much more difficult model to build, and likely less coherent. Hence, we decided to include macro indicators that could be used a surrogate identity. For example, if we knew of US's GDP, we could predict the US food waste based on GDP. Building on this idea, we wanted to include macro variables that would be likely have a relationship with agriculture. This drove us to select the following variables: GDP, Agriculture as % of GDP, Agricultural Land as % of Total Land, and Population. Using these quantitative variables, we hope to replicate the characteristics of different countries, and thereby, examining why some countries waste more than others. 

Given that our data dates back to 1960s, we were also interested other bigger world trends. For example:

  Has food waste decreased/increased over time?
  What is the projected food waste loss for a specific region in 2023?
  On average, how much does the world waste?
  Are there specific countries that are outliers (waste much more/less food than everyone else)?


|           In building our the next section of our data analysis, we will be using our "Aggregate Data" file which is the data file that consolidates all the datasets introduced. The main statistical analysis that we have conducted was using regression models, specifically simple and multi-regression. 

```{r include=FALSE}
AggData <- read_csv(here::here("dataset/AggData.csv"))
load(here::here("dataset/AggData.RData"))
```

|           These are the packages that will be used in our analysis.

```{r echo = T}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(olsrr))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(kableExtra))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(corrplot))
```
|           Given that the production was the first initial variable that we were curious about, we wanted to start our analysis by building a model to look specifically at production and loss. 

|           The first model that we introduce is a simple regression model that examines the relationship between 'Loss in tonnes' and 'Production in tonnes'.  Based on these two variables, it appears there exists a positive relationship between 'Loss' and 'Production'. Looking at this model, we can see that there exists a small relationship between the two variables. The correlation is aorund 0.413, which could be interpreted as below-average to average correlation. Based on its p-value, it seems that this model is also statistically significant. However, this model alone cannot help answer many of our other questions. In terms of food loss, there are many other variables needed in order to understand the situation. 

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
model1 <- lm(Loss ~ Production, data = AggData)
summary(model1)
corr_a <- AggData %>% select(Loss, Production)
cor(corr_a)
```

|           Hence, in this second model, we expanded upon the original simple model into a multi-regression model including other macro predictors that we had originally been interested in: 'Year', 'GDP', 'Agriculture as Percentage of GDP', 'Percentage of Land used for Agriculture', 'Population', and 'Production'. 

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
model2 <- lm(Loss ~ Year + GDP + AgriGDP + AgriLand + Population + Production, data = AggData)
summary(model2)

variable_corr <- AggData %>% 
  select(-LossPercentage)

corrplot(cor(variable_corr, use = "pairwise.complete.obs"), method = "number", type = "upper")
```

|           However, upon expanding the model, based on the p-values, it appears that only three out of six predictors proved to be statistically significant. To further this analysis, we generated a correlation matrix to examine potential reasons causing some variables to be "insignificant". As evident, a large portion of the macro predictors were highly correlated. For example, 'GDP' and 'Population' is nearly '1' as is 'Production' and 'Year'. This suggests that, potentially, there exists some level of interaction between some of the variables that causes the other to become "insignificant" in the model. Meaning, we would either have to eliminate some of our variables or transform them. 

The potential interaction between the predictors, therefore, prompts the next step in our analysis. In the next step, using the "olsrr" package, we generated all possible predictors and interaction terms up to three levels (x1 * x2 * x3) to determine the most appropriate predictors based the package's default statistical tests (p-value and AIC). Below we have generated the top 10 variables as determined by the function. 

Furthermore, this multi-regression model is also not the "best" model to be used in our analysis. We can see that the model shows a significant negative intercept. The negative intercept itself is logically flawed as it suggests "negative" loss when all other predictor are zero-ed. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
all_variables <- ols_step_all_possible(model2) 
colnames(all_variables)[1:5] <- c('Index', 'n', 'Predictors', 'R-Square', 'Adj R-Square')
```

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
all_variables %>% 
  head(10) %>% 
  summarise(Index, n, Predictors, `R-Square`, `Adj R-Square`) %>% 
  kbl(caption = "All Possible Variables") %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria", fixed_thead = T, position = "center")
```

|           With the output listing the Top 10 predictor variables, it appears that 'AgriGDP', 'AgriLand', and 'Year' are the top three predictors in potentially explaining levels of 'Loss'. Using this information, we proceeded to construct a second multi-regression model in attempt to examine the relationship they have on 'Loss'. The reason we stopped at three was also because we are generally comfortable with using these three variables to answer some of our questions. For example 'Year' can allow us to identity the year and looking into other qualitative factors. Agriculture as a percentage GDP is still related to our original question of GDP. And last agricultural land provided potential insights into a countries agricultural practices. 

```{r echo=F, fig.align='center'}
model3 <- lm(Loss ~ Year + AgriGDP + AgriLand, data = AggData)
summary(model3)
```

|           In reference to the new model, it appears that similar problems persists. Firstly, the intercept again remains negative, which as previously discussed, is flawed. Additionally, the new model that was constructed based on examing all variables still gives predictors that prove to be statistically insignifiant. Hence, in our next step we proceeded with a step-wise forward predictor selection process. The package uses the predictor's p-values to construct a model with statistically significant predictors. 

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
ols_step_forward_p(model2)
```

|           The conclusion drawn from our variable selection was that 'AgriGDP' alone is the most appropriate predictor among all available data in our 'AggData' file. Thus, building our final model, we have the simple regression model below: 

```{r echo = F}
model4 <- model1 <- lm(Loss ~ AgriGDP, data = AggData)
summary(model4)

corr_b <- AggData %>% select(Loss, AgriGDP)
cor(corr_b, use = "pairwise.complete.obs")
```
      
|           The following model demonstrates a negative relationship between 'Loss' and 'Agriculture as a Percentage of GDP', where correlation â‰ˆ -0.484. This conclusion was initially counter-intuitive as one would likely assume that greater percentage of agriculture as GDP likely means more production and consumption. Upon further analysis (refer back to correlation matrix), we found that 'GDP' has a negative correlation to 'AgriGDP'. Hence, there likely exists factors within the 'AgriGDP' data that explains this relationship. For example, 'AgriGDP' includes data for both import and export of agricultural goods. The 'Loss' data itself reports only loss in production that occurred domestically. Hence, if a country imports a greater proportion of its agricultural goods as opposed to producing domestically, the net effect could indeed be negative. And while the new simple regression model's correlation between the predictor and response variables is still below-average, there appears to be a slight increase. This, while, more promising, still suggests that there exists other factors outside of our consideration that are more appropriate in helping project food production loss. 

|           And despite the final model being more statistically appropriate, and with consideration of all previous models, we determined that our analysis were inconclusive. Even based on the statistically significant final model, we still lack evidence to answer if more developed countries waste more, or how food production relates to food loss. The lack of an effective model meant that any analysis drawn using the model would be flawed. 

|           However, using these flaws we have provided potential avenues to further explore this topic. For example, instead of GDP, it was suggested that perhaps income may be a better and more significant predictor of food waste. And with income levels, this will allow for an even more detailed analysis as income can vary greatly even by county, thus, allowing the model to zoom in and out, from city to country. We could also have looked at more specific factors rather than the macro indicators. For example, we could look into average member of household, average spending on groceries, or government spending on agriculture. Perhaps these even more micro factors are better representation of different countries rather than the macro factors. Or alternatively, given the availability and completeness of the US's data, the analysis could look at US alone. 

Additionally, while we examined many variables and their interaction terms, we, however, did not transform them. Therefore, another potential change to our analysis could be to log transform variables like GDP to see if there exists better correlation. 

|           In addition, the insignificance may also be due to some inherent flaws in our data. 
  
|           One of the biggest inherent flaws with the data is the inconsistencies of data on a year-to-year basis. However, this flaw is unlikely to be addressed or fixed. Because not every country has the same resources, some countries may choose to report data on a bi-annual bases or every three to five years, and some countries many not be as capable in its collection of data. Therefore, while countries like US report every year and rather completely, other countries like Myanmar may not be as comprehensive. 

Additionally, our original food loss data was sourced as a percentage but the food production data was in units. In our data cleaning process, we had to calculate the food loss in tonnes manual using the two datasets. Hence, there were some numbers loss in translation as not all matches up. This likely also impacted our data and therefore our analysis. This problem, however, is also due to the unfortunate method that the data was collected. FAO of the UN collects their data through public information reported by each country's government, universities, outside institutions, or non-profits. Meaning that this was a consolidation of different datasets, as such may not be completely correct or comprehensive. 

While some of our more curious questions were unanswered, the exploratory analysis still provided greater insight into the topic. For example, we were able to better under some of the commodities that the United States wasted the most. We were also able to get more insight into what waste looks like in each country. The macro data by itself also provided insight into how factors in each country has changed over time. It was also interesting to learn that overall food waste is gradually decreasing. While our quantitative data is unable to answer that, we theorize that it is due to the increased efficiency of the agriculture sector that has allowed for gradually decline in loss. 

Given the depth of the subject, there are many components that factor into overall food waste, and there are directions that the study can extend into.
